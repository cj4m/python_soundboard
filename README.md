Requirements:
Python 3.6+
keyboard module (only works on windows)
playsound module

Scancodes are strictly for numpad, so it would be Num0, Num1, etc. instead of numbers above alpha keys.
Change .mp3 files to your own with proper names/paths.

Great replacement for an Elgato streamdeck if you just want to use a soundboard. More tools required like digital audio cable for use in Discord, but it will work.
